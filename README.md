# Trace Schemas

This repository holds json schemas and tools for validating Climate Trace data. Generally Climate Trace data extends the GeoJson schema (specifically [FeatureCollection](https://geojson.org/schema/FeatureCollection.json) ) to provide needed metadata by declaring a profile of required elements within each Feature's properties.
